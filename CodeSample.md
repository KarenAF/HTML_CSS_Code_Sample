## The Difference Engine

##### Since this code is taken from a Ruby on Rails app, I've pasted it in one place. When taken out of the Rails app, it isn't fully interactive or representative of the original UI, but it does give an idea of what it looks like. Please refer to [TDE][]this page to see the full code.

### CSS:
```
.list-content {
  position: relative;
  width: 75%;
  left: 10%;
  background: #F2F2F2;
  margin: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #888888;
  padding: 10px;
}

.arrow-steps {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
